# GestionareBanca
In this project I aim to track the accounts enrolled in a certain bank and their transactions. The account types are either current account or economies where you have the option of choosing an interest rate for either 3, 6 or 12 months. The bank offers a set number of free transactions and then adds a fee for each transaction and also for transactions done from another bank. 
You can enroll an account, view the current accounts in a bank and the number of economies accounts as well as see the bank details from the console menu.
