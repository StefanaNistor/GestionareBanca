# Bank Management
## Overview
The project is designed to track bank accounts and their associated transactions from a bank. The system supports two account types: *current accounts* and *savings accounts*. Users can select an interest rate for savings accounts, with options for *3, 6, or 12 months*. The bank provides a limited number of free transactions, after which fees apply for both internal transactions and those conducted with external banks. Users can enroll new accounts, view existing accounts, and access detailed bank information through a console-based menu.
